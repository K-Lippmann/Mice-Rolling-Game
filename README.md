# Mice-Rolling-Game
In this program I want to simulate a game which already exists in real life. In this game you usally have two pig figurines which you throw and depending on the way they land you get points. After each throw one can decide if to throw again or to pass, as long as the previous throw wasn't the one throw which let's you lose the game.
